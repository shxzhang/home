											<h2>About me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hi! I'm Shuxiao Zhang. I also go by Susan, and I am currently a graduate student in Professor Georgia Drakakaki's lab in the Department of Plant Sciences at UC Davis. I am currently completing my second PhD.</p>
										<p>(Yes that's right. My first PhD is in Biomedical Sciences and my second one (in progress) is in Plant Sciences.)</p>
										<p>This means that in addition to research experience spanning neuroanatomy, behavior analyses, pulmonary hypertension, plant developmental anatomy, and plant abiotic
										stress response, I am also qualified to teach across a broad range of subjects. I am particularly interested in undergraduate science education, with a focus on promoting
										undergraduate research experience and hands-on activities as a built-in part of course work.</p>
										<p>For summary of my full qualifications, please click on my CV in the link below:</p>

									<h2>Research</h2>
								</header>
								<p>My main research interested right now is in plant resiliency to climate change. Specifically, while there is extensive amount of research about the response of Arabidopsis
								to various types of abiotic stress such as heat, drought, salinity, etc., there is limited knowledge about how perennial crops, especially trees, would respond to
								these challenges. Furthermore, many of these challenges, such as drought and soil salinization, occur together under field conditions. I am particularly interested in what happens if stresses that
								when applied individually would result in opposing changes occur together.</p>
								<p>Currently my work mainly focuses on pistachios, a woody perennial crop known for its relatively high salinity and drought tolerance. 
									Much less is known about abiotic stress tolerance in woody crops compared to annual crops or Arabidopsis due to their long 
									generation time and difficulty in micropropagation / in-bred lines. However, for the same reasons, their long life span means 
									that it is likely that woody plants will employ different mechanisms for resiliency compared to annuals, and the popularity 
									of crops such as pistachios, almonds, walnuts, as well as many fruits, means that there is a pressing need to understand climate 
									change resiliency for these crops.</p>

									<h2>THE DARK CYCLE</h2>
									<p>THE DARK CYCLE is a instructional boardgame about photosynthesis for undergraduate and higher levels of education. <br>
									(It comes with 2 levels of game play, simple and advanced. Advanced is recommended for people who major / work in biology / biology related fields.)</p>
									<p>Download the game for FREE <a href="https://github.com/shxzhang/THE-DARK-CYCLE">here</a>.</p>
									<p>You'll need to download the game board, the player pieces, and the rules. Advanced players will also need the stress factor cards.</p>

							<section id="accused" class="main special">
								<header class="major">
									<h2>THE ACCUSED</h2>
									<p>THE THE ACCUSED is a murder mystery game suitable for undergraduate laboratory material that involves identification of samples (e.g. identifying cell types, soil type, plant type).</p>
									<p>It is originally developed for the PLB105 Plant Anatomy course at UC Davis and can be adapted easily for any course material that contains identification via dichotomous keying.</p>
									<p>In addition to providing a fun way to engage with course material, the game provides one way for the students to appreciate the importance of paying attention to details, the relevancy of being 
										able to identify key samples (especially in the context of forensic science), and the logic of dichotomous keying</p>
									<p>Download the game (powerpoint slides) for FREE <a href="https://github.com/shxzhang/accused">here</a>.</p>
