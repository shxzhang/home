									<h2>Research</h2>
								</header>
								<p>I am currently interested in research topics about plant resiliency to climate change. Specifically I am interested using plant 
									anatomical analyses featuring high resolution microscopy as the "phenome" end of the phenome to genome discourse to study gene x 
									environment interactions.</p>
								<p>Currently my work mainly focuses on pistachios, a woody perennial crop known for its relatively high salinity and drought tolerance. 
									Much less is known about abiotic stress tolerance in woody crops compared to annual crops or Arabidopsis due to their long 
									generation time and difficulty in micropropagation / in-bred lines. However, for the same reasons, their long life span means 
									that it is likely that woody plants will employ different mechanisms for resiliency compared to annuals, and the popularity 
									of crops such as pistachios, almonds, walnuts, as well as many fruits, means that there is a pressing need to understand climate 
									change resiliency for these crops.</p>

									<h2>THE DARK CYCLE</h2>
									<p>THE DARK CYCLE is a instructional boardgame about photosynthesis for undergraduate and higher levels of education. <br>
									(It comes with 2 levels of game play, simple and advanced. Advanced is recommended for people who major / work in biology / biology related fields.)</p>
									<p>Download the game for FREE <a href="https://github.com/shxzhang/THE-DARK-CYCLE">here</a>.</p>
									<p>You'll need to download the game board, the player pieces, and the rules. Advanced players will also need the stress factor cards.</p>
